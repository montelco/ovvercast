# ovvercast
A weather guided music recommendation engine. Plug in your Last.FM account to get perfected recommendations.

# What it is
Overcast is built using PHP, Last.fm's API, Spotify's API (coming soon), and 8Track's API (coming soon.)

# Who is it for
I built ovvercast in an afternoon because I wanted some new music to listen to. During that I figured out that it'd be cool to have great music no matter the weather. Hence, ovvercast exists.

# Who can modify it
I ask that anyone wishing to modify or use ovvercast in their project please change the API keys to their own (pretty please).
If you are looking to make money off of using ovvercast, please at least give me credit somewhere on the project. :)

#Happy listening!
